## 📖 Overview

Focal is a single-page site where the hero itself is a working product: a live countdown ring that runs real focus/break cycles, not a screenshot standing in for one.

- 📊 **Daily session count** - tracked locally per day, no account required
- 🌗 **Light / dark mode** - toggle in the header, remembered on return visits
- 📱 **Mobile-first responsive layout** - single column on phones, expands at tablet (768px) and desktop (1024px) breakpoints
- ♿ **Accessible by default** - semantic landmarks, visible focus states, `prefers-reduced-motion` support, skip link

## 🧭 Usage

1. Choose a focus duration (15, 25, or 50 minutes).
2. Click **Start** to begin the countdown.
3. Watch the animated progress ring as the timer runs.
4. After a focus session ends, Focal automatically starts a break timer.
5. Toggle between light and dark mode anytime using the header switch.
6. Your theme preference and daily completed sessions are automatically saved in your browser.

## 🔮 Future Improvements
